CLASSES AND OBJECTS:\n","       In Python, a class is a template for crreating objects. A class defines the properties and behaviour of an object.\n","       An Object is an instance of a class, and has its own set of attributes(data) and methods(functions).\n","\n","2. INHERITANCE:\n","      Inheritance is the mechanism by which one class can inherit the properties and behaviour of another class.\n","      The child class inherites all the attributes and methods of the parent class and can also add new attributes\n","      and methods or overrides the ones instead of inherited from the parent class.\n","\n","3. ENCAPSULATION:\n","      Encapsulation is the concept of building data and methods that manipulates the data into a single unit, making it\n","      harder for other parts of the program to access or modify the data directly. In Python, Encapsulation is achieved\n","       using classes and objects.\n","\n","4. ABSTRACTION:\n","      Abstraction is the concept of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the implementation\n","       details. In Python, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.\n","\n","\n","5. POLYMORPHISM:\n","      polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Python, polymorphism can be achieved through\n","       method overloading or method overriding.\n","\n","'''"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Q2.
